# Power-Bi-Projects
This repository contains all the projects that I have performed in Power Bi

The first project is Customer Churn Analysis. 
Customer churn analysis is the process of examining and understanding why customers stop using a company's product or service. Churn refers to the rate at which customers discontinue their relationship with a company within a specific period.
I have attached the xlsx. file that contains the dataset.
